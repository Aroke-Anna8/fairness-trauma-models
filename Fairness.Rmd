# Introduction

Trauma continues to be a major contributor to the global burden of
disease [@James2018], with an estimated 973 million injuries requiring health
intervention in 2013 alone [@haagsma2016]<!-- Revised this to be more
direct. Please check for a more recent reference than 2-->. Annually,
nearly 6 million people die from trauma and over 90% of these deaths
occur in low- and middle-income countries [@WHO2010]<!-- This is quite
outdated. The latest GBD study indicate that the number of deaths is
closer to  4.5 million -->.

With an expected increase in trauma globally [@WHO2010], it is imperative
that holistic trauma care is guided by involving various components of
health systems. This necessitates using prognostic trauma prediction
models that include clinical parameters, anatomical distribution,
injury severity scores [@tohira2012], and the type and quality of trauma
intervention required in the short and long term<!-- Although the flow
is nice I'm not sure I follow the logic. What is the connection
between holistic trauma care and prediction models? Why does the
provision of the former require the latter? Prediction models may be
needed to guide clinical decision making, quality assurance, and
research. Maybe you can find a link there?--> .

Deaths from trauma occur nearly twice as often in men compared with
women. Road traffic injury related deaths, which account for a quarter
of the annual global trauma fatalities, occur almost three times as
much in men than in women<!-- See edit of previous sentence
-->. However, more women die from burns caused by fires [@WHO2010]. This
disproportionality can be attributed to historical trends of increased
risk-taking behavior and interpersonal violence in men<!-- Or that
women don't reach health facilities... This sentence need an up to
date reference-->.

There is a paucity of literature studying the effect of pre-clinical
factors such as sex on trauma outcomes, and prediction models continue
to be designed with the same perceptional disparity [@spani2018]<!-- Are you
sure this reference discuss prediction models? It looks like it deals
with preclinical model systems.-->. However, given the increased
participation of women in activities exposing them to higher risk of
trauma, such an inherent bias in predicted outcomes can potentially
affect the quality of trauma care provided to women<!-- Also that many
models that are currently being used were developed in samples in
which a majority were males. I think this paragraph would benefit from
mentioning some of these models and the samples in which they were
developed. Look at TRISS, RTS and KTS (Kampala trauma score), for
example.-->

It therefore stands to reason that fairness in trauma prediction
models based on differences of sex need to be evaluated. This can help
identify and correct any potential flaws in these models and improve
trauma outcomes by informing better treatment protocols. The aim of
this study is to apply various trauma prediction models on data
focusing on both men and women and comparing each to assess the level
of fairness<!-- This paragraph is okay for now-->.
