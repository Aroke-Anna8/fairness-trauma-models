# Fairness in Trauma Prediction Models

## Introduction

Physical injuries and their associated physiological responses
continue to be a major contributor to the global burden of disease
^(1)^. According to the Global Burden of Disease report, an estimated
973 million incidences of injuries requiring a health intervention
occurred in 2013 alone ^(2)^. Annually, nearly 6 million people die
due to injuries and over 90% of these deaths occur in low- and
middle-income countries ^(3)^.

With an expected increase in the global trend of violent injuries
^(3)^, it is imperative that holistic trauma care is guided by
involving various components of health systems. This necessitates
using prognostic trauma prediction models that include clinical
parameters, anatomical distribution, injury severity scores ^(4)^, and
the type and quality of trauma intervention required in the short and
long term.

Deaths due to injuries occur nearly twice as much in men than in
women. Road traffic injury related deaths, which account for a quarter
of the annual global trauma fatalities, occur almost three times as
much in men than in women. However, more women die from burn injuries
caused by fires ^(3)^. This disproportionality can be attributed to
historical trends of increased risk-taking behavior and interpersonal
violence in men.

There is a paucity of literature studying the effect of pre-clinical
factors such as sex on trauma outcomes, and prediction models continue
to be designed with the same perceptional disparity ^(5)^. However,
given the increased participation of women in activities exposing them
to higher risk of trauma, such an inherent bias in predicted outcomes
can potentially affect the quality of trauma care provided to women.

It therefore stands to reason that fairness in trauma prediction
models based on differences of sex need to be evaluated. This can help
identify and correct any potential flaws in these models and improve
trauma outcomes by informing better treatment protocols. The aim of
this study is to apply various trauma prediction models on data
focusing on both men and women and comparing each to assess the level
of fairness.
