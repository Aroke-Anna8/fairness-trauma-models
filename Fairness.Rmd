# Fairness in Trauma Prediction Models

## Introduction

Trauma continues to be a major contributor to the global burden of
disease, with an estimated 520 million injuries requiring health
interventions in 2017 alone ^(1)^ Annually, nearly 4.5 million people die due to trauma and over 90% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries ^(2)^. 

With an expected increase in trauma globally ^(3)^, it is imperative that holistic trauma care is guided not only by injury severity scores and emergency treatment guidelines, but by also taking into account the contextual differences in trauma settings such as gender or health economics ^(4)^. A way to improve those could be development of more inclusive prediction models that would inform better clinical judgement and ensure quality research and revision.

Traumatic deaths occur nearly twice as much in men than in women. Road traffic injury related deaths, which account for a quarter of trauma fatalities worldwide, occur almost three times as much in men than in women. However, more women die from burn injuries caused by fires ^(3)^. This disproportionality can be attributed to increased incidences of interpersonal violence in men ^(5)^, and women seeking delayed medical care ^(6)^.

Although there is limited and conflicting evidence of the protective effects of female gender on trauma outcomes ^(7,8)^, trauma databases include more male subjects ^(9,10)^ and prediction models continue to be designed with the same perceptional disparity. Most injury severity scores presently in use such as the Kampala Trauma Score (KTS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), A Severity Characterization Of Trauma (ASCOT) and Base deficit and Injury Severity Score (BISS), were also developed with a majority male population database ^(11,12)^. However, given the increased participation of women in activities exposing them to higher risk of trauma, such an inherent bias in predicted outcomes can potentially affect the quality of trauma care provided to women.

It therefore stands to reason that fairness in trauma prediction models based on differences of sex needs to be evaluated. This can help identify and correct any potential flaws in these models and improve trauma outcomes by informing better treatment protocols. The aim of this study is to apply various trauma prediction models on data focusing on both men and women and comparing each to assess the level of fairness.

## Methods  

_1.1 Study design & data sources_

The study is a retrospective, comparative analysis of an existing
multicenter, trauma registry dataset based on the TITCO
(Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes) cohort. 

_1.2 Key study dates_

This retrospective analysis was carried out between [dates] based
on data directly observed or retrieved from patient records between
July 2013 and December 2015.

_2.1 Study setting_

The patient data was collected from four hospitals within urban,
Indian cities of Mumbai, New Delhi & Kolkata. This included two
tertiary care hospitals with dedicated trauma wards and one without,
while the fourth was a dedicated trauma center.

_2.2 Eligibility criteria_

All patients presenting with trauma, alive at the time of arrival,
and who were admitted to the hospitals were included in the dataset,
regardless of age or gender. Those dying between arrival and
admission were also included. The exclusion criteria were subjects
dead on arrival and those presenting exclusively with peripheral injuries. 

_2.3 Treatment details_

Patients requiring surgical intervention for injuries following
immediate emergency treatment for injuries were operated upon depending
on type and severity of injury. _[Not sure how much detail is required here]._

_3.1 Predicted outcome_

The predicted outcome would be death following trauma with or
without surgical intervention, within 48 hours to 30 days from
time of arrival at the hospital.

_3.2 Actions to blind outcome assessment_

Using a standardized criterion to record patient data regardless
of demographic details and including all predefined predictors
as applicable.

_4.1 Predictors and measurement_

-	Grouping trauma by anatomical regions based on the abbreviated
        injury scale (AIS).
-	Assigning an AIS grading to each primary injury and any secondary
        injuries – recorded via CT reports, x-ray findings, FAST findings,
        intraoperative diagnosis & physician notes.
-	Assigning standardized ICD-10 codes for nature of injury.
-	Assigning injury severity scores (ISS) and new injury severity
        scores (NISS) to all subjects based on the AIS.
-	Recording vital sign parameters at fixed time intervals for all patients.
-	Recording GCS scores at fixed time intervals for all patients.
-	Recording hemoglobin and hematocrit status on admission for all patients.

_4.2 Actions to blind predictor assessment_

-	Ensuring expert opinion in recording intraoperative diagnoses
        and assigning primary injury.
-	Following standardized coding methods (ICD-10)
-	Ensuring all coders receive similar standardized training
        for data collection. 

_5. Sample size_

The sample size comprised of 16,000 trauma patients received at the four
participating hospitals.

_6. Missing data_

Patients parameters that could not be directly observed in the
trauma/resuscitation unit were retrieved from hospital records to
ensure uniformity of data. Subjects with incomplete data were
excluded from assessment.

_7.1 Predictor analysis_

All descriptors were compared for survivors and non-survivors
through descriptive statistical analyses and using logistical
regression where required. Continuous variables were calculated
using student t-test. Odds Ratios were calculated for non-survivors
against relevant descriptors. All categorical variables were assessed
_[via Chi-square?]_ for data divided by female and male sex.

_7.2 Type of model and predictor selection_

Predictive models for trauma mortality, based on anatomical distribution
of injuries and physiological variables were applied to the dataset.
Predictive value of site and type of injury; changes in systolic blood
pressure, heart rate & GCS scores; differences in time of injury, time
of arrival and first surgical intervention was assessed and validated
_[does the receiver operating characteristics curve have a function here?]_

_7.3 Measures used to assess & compare model performance_

Standard error of means was calculated for analyzed variables and compared
across various predictive models applied to the dataset based on gender
differences. _[Mention ROCC?]_

_8. Risk groups_

Female sex was identified as a potentially underserved group due
to a larger number of male subjects within the database and variables
were analyzed against data divided by gender.
