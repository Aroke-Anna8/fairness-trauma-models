# Fairness in Trauma Prediction Models

## Introduction

Trauma continues to be a major contributor to the global burden of
disease - an estimated 520 million injuries required health
interventions in 2017 alone [@James2018]. Annually, nearly 4.5 million people
die due to trauma and over 90% of these deaths occur in low- and
middle-income countries [@Roth2018].

Trauma mortality prediction models aim to quantify prognostic variables
in traumatic injuries to predict the probability of survival in different
categories of trauma patients. These models ensure better quality control
and evaluation of trauma systems to improve outcomes [@Cook2014]. Indices
such as the Injury Severity Score (ISS), the New Injury Severity Score (NISS)
and Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (TMPM) are based on anatomic region of
injury [@Haider2012]. The ISS and NISS employ the Abbreviated Injury Scale
(AIS) which assigns scores based on region and type of anatomic structure
injured and the severity of the injury. The TMPM can be based either on the
AIS or the International Classification of Diseases 10th Clinical Modification
(ICD-10-CM) coding of injuries [@Osler2019]. 

Other models use a combination of anatomic and physiological parameters to
predict mortality. These include the Kampala Trauma Score (KTS) which uses age,
systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR), neurological status and
number of injuries; Revised Trauma Score (RTS), uses the Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS), SBP and RR [@Akay2017]; Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which
is a combination of RTS, ISS and age index, A Severity Characterization of
Trauma (ASCOT), which uses AIS, RTS and age [@Champion1996]; and Base-deficit
Injury Severity Score (BISS), which employs the base-deficit, ISS and age
index [@Lam2016].

Trauma databases include more men than women [@Haider2009; @Meng2019],
and most trauma severity scores were developed in overwhelmingly male populations
[@Akay2017; @Tohira2012]. The effect of this inherent bias on the fairness
(distribution of model errors) has not been previously studied
despite potentially affecting the quality of care provided to women.

The study of fairness in trauma prediction models can help identify
and correct potential flaws in these models and improve trauma
outcomes by informing better treatment protocols. The aim of this
study is to assess and compare the fairness of various trauma
prediction models.


## Methods


### 1.1 Study design & data sources

Our study is a retrospective analysis of the anonymous multicentre
Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes (TITCO) in India cohort.

### 1.2 Key study dates

We conducted this analysis between [dates] based on data directly
observed or retrieved from patient records between July 2013 and
December 2015.

### 2.1 Study setting

The patient data was collected from four hospitals within urban,
Indian cities of Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata. This included two
tertiary care hospitals with dedicated trauma wards and one without,
while the fourth was a dedicated trauma centre.

### 2.2 Eligibility criteria

The TITCO cohort includes all patients presenting with trauma, alive
at the time of arrival, and who were admitted to the participating
hospitals, regardless of age or gender. Those dying between arrival
and admission were also included. The exclusion criteria were subjects
dead on arrival and those presenting exclusively with peripheral
injuries.

### 3.1 Predicted outcome

The predicted outcome is death following trauma with or without
surgical intervention, from time of arrival to hospital to 30 days after.

### 3.2 Actions to blind outcome assessment

All data was collected based on standardized criteria regardless of
demographic details and outcomes, including all predefined predictors
as applicable.

### 4.1 Predictors and measurement

- AIS score
- ICD-10 coding
- SBP
- RR
- GCS
- Age (index)
- Number of injuries

### 4.2 Actions to blind predictor assessment

- Ensuring expert opinion in recording intraoperative diagnoses and assigning primary injury.
- Following standardized coding methods (ICD-10)
- Ensuring all coders receive similar standardized training for data collection. 
	

### 5. Sample size

```{r sample-size-calculation, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

library(pwr)

stats <- pwr.t.test(d = 0.2, power = 0.8, type = "two.sample", alternative = "two.sided")
stats.paired <- pwr.t.test(d = 0.2, power = 0.8, type = "paired", alternative = "two.sided")

```

The TITCO cohort includes 16,000 trauma patients admitted to the four
participating hospitals. We need at least `r stats$n` men and as
many women, coming to a minimum total sample size of `r stats$n*2`,
to detect an effect size of 0.2 (considered a small effect size
[@Cohen1988; @Lakens2013]) when comparing the mean absolute prediction
error between men and women for any model with 80% power and a
significance level of 5%.

### 6. Missing data

We will perform a complete case analysis, meaning that patients with
missing values in any predictor or outcome will be excluded.

### 7.1 Predictor analysis

[Predictor value description, separately for men and women.]

### 7.2 Type of model and predictor selection

The data collected in the TITCO cohort allows for the comparison of the
ISS, NISS, TMPM-ICD-10-CM, KTS, TRISS and ASCOT models. The variables
representative of these models are listed above.

### 7.3 Measures used to assess and compare model performance

The Mean Absolute Prediction Error (MAPE) for each specified model
was calculated and compared for differences in sex via independent t-tests.
Comparisons of MAPE differences across each model were done via paired
t-tests to assess level of fairness [definition provided elsewhere].
