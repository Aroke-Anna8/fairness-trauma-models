abstract = {Background Mortality prediction of trauma patients relies on anatomical, physiological or combined scores. The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the modified Kampala Trauma Score (M-KTS) with the Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (TMPM), and Trauma-Injury Severity Score (TRISS) using data from a large dataset from a developed registry, the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). Methods Using 2011 and 2012 data from NTDB, patient based trauma scores (M-KTS, TMPM, and TRISS) were calculated and predictive ability of M-KTS for mortality was compared with other trauma scores using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results A total of 841 089 patients were included in the study. TRISS outperformed other scores (AUC = 0.922, {\%}95 CI 0.920–0.924) with M-KTS as the second best score (AUC = 0.901, {\%}95 CI 0.899–0.903) followed by TMPM (AUC = 0.887, 95{\%} CI 0.844–0.889). For blunt trauma, TRISS (AUC = 0.917, 95{\%} CI 0.915–0.919) performed better than M-KTS (AUC = 0.891, {\%}95 CI 0.889–0.893) and TMPM (AUC = 0.874, 95{\%} CI 0.871–0.877). For penetrating trauma, M-KTS (AUC = 0.956, 95{\%} CI 0.954–0.959) and TMPM (AUC = 0.955, 95{\%} CI 0.951–0.958) had similar performance after TRISS (AUC = 0.969, 95{\%} CI 0.967–0.971). Conclusion M-KTS performed worse than TRISS although its' main advantage is simple use in resource-limited settings.},

abstract = {TRISS calculated norms as an outcomes predictor has been used in trauma quality improvement programs since approximately 1986. Injury predictability and probabilities of survival with TRISS focus predominantly on motor vehicle crashes and have been limited due to poor calculations for penetrating injury and adjustment for age factors. In 1990, an additional scoring system was introduced, A Severity Characterization of Trauma (ASCOT), to potentially present a more accurate predictability scoring system. Utilizing the data from four Level I Trauma Centers from 1987 to 1989, a comparative analysis was conducted on the accuracy of scoring systems. The findings indicate that for blunt injured adults, ASCOT had a higher sensitivity than TRISS, and for penetrating adult injuries, ASCOT and TRISS sensitivities had an equally low accuracy. For pediatric patients, TRISS and ASCOT sensitivities were comparable. Overall, the ASCOT scoring system accounted for age differential and severity of injury differential more accurately in four categories, allowing for a more accurate calibration. The ASCOT model seemed better for predicting survival than the TRISS model in that it had a higher sensitivity and met the Hosmer-lemeshow criterion for calibration, whereas the TRISS did not. {\textcopyright} 1996 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Performance benchmarking requires accurate measurement of injury severity. Despite its shortcomings, the Injury Severity Score (ISS) remains the industry standard 40 years after its creation. A new severity measure, the Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (TMPM), uses either the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) or DRG International Classification of DiseasesV9th Rev. (ICD-9) lexicons and may better quantify injury severity compared with ISS. We compared the performance of TMPM with ISS and other measures of injury severity in a single cohort of patients. METHODS: We included 337,359 patient records with injuries reliably described in both the AIS and the ICD-9 lexicons from the National Trauma Data Bank. Five injury severity measures (ISS, maximum AIS score, New Injury Severity Score [NISS], ICD-9YBased Injury Severity Score [ICISS], TMPM) were computed using either the AIS or ICD-9 codes. These measures were compared for discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), an estimate of proximity to a model that perfectly predicts the outcome (Akaike information criterion), and model calibration curves. RESULTS: TMPM demonstrated superior receiver operating characteristic curve, Akaike information criterion, and calibration using either the AIS or ICD-9 lexicons. Calibration plots demonstrate the monotonic characteristics of the TMPM models contrasted by the nonmonotonic features of the other prediction models. CONCLUSION: Severity measures were more accurate with the AIS lexicon rather than ICD-9. NISS proved superior to ISS in either lexicon. Since NISS is simpler to compute, it should replace ISS when a quick estimate of injury severity is required for AIS-coded injuries. Calibration curves suggest that the nonmonotonic nature of ISS may undermine its performance. TMPM demonstrated superior overall mortality prediction compared with all other models including ISS whether the AIS or ICD-9 lexicons were used. Because TMPM provides an absolute probability of death, it may allow clinicians to communicate more precisely with one another and with patients and families.

abstract = {Background: Studies of sexual dimorphism in trauma outcomes suggest that women have a survival advantage compared to equivalently injured men. It is unknown if this gender disparity is mediated by potentially life-threatening complications. Objective: To determine (1) if there is a sex-based differences in the odds of developing inpatient complications after trauma, and (2) if are these complications associated with death among trauma patients. Methods: Review of adult trauma patients admitted to hospitals in the National Trauma Data Bank that report complications. Patient and injury severity covariates were adjusted using multiple logistic regression and the independent effect of sex on developing complications and associated mortality was determined. Results: A total of 681,730 adult patients met the inclusion criteria of hospital admission ≥3 days. Women demonstrated a 21{\%} lower adjusted risk of death compared to males (OR 0.79, 95{\%} CI 0.76-0.83). Females had decreased adjusted odds of developing life-threatening complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure and pulmonary embolism. However, when compared to males with life-threatening complications, females with complications were found to be at greater risk of dying. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that women are less likely than men to develop inpatient complications, suggesting that the survival advantage among women after traumatic injury may involve a reduced susceptibility to developing life-threatening complications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Mosby, Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Optimum quantification of injury severity remains an imprecise science with a need for improvement. The accuracy of the criterion standard Injury Severity Score (ISS) worsens as a patient's injury severity increases, especially among patients with penetrating trauma. The objective of this study was to comprehensively compare the mortality prediction ability of three anatomic injury severity indices: the ISS, the New ISS (NISS), and the DRG International Classification of Diseases-9th Rev.-Trauma Mortality Prediction Model (TMPM-ICD-9), a recently developed contemporary injury assessment model. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2007 to 2008. The TMPM-ICD-9 values were computed and compared with the ISS and NISS for each patient using in-hospital mortality after trauma as the outcome measure. Discrimination and calibration were compared using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Subgroup analysis was performed to compare each score across varying ranges of injury severity and across different types of injury. RESULTS: A total of 533,898 patients were identified with a crude mortality rate of 4.7{\%}. The ISS and NISS performed equally in the groups with minor (ISS, 1-8) and moderate (ISS, 9-15) injuries, regardless of the injury type. However, in the populations with severe (ISS, 16-24) and very severe (ISS, ≥25) injuries for all injury types, the NISS predicted mortality better than the ISS did. The TMPM-ICD-9 outperformed both the NISS and ISS almost consistently. CONCLUSION: The NISS and TMPM-ICD-9 are both superior predictors of mortality as compared with the ISS. The immediate adoption of NISS for evaluating trauma outcomes using trauma registry data is recommended. The TMPM-ICD-9 may be an even better measure of human injury, and its use in administrative or nonregistry data is suggested. Further research on its attributes is recommended because it has the potential to become the basis for benchmarking trauma outcomes.

abstract = {Background: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Findings: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 3{\textperiodcentered}1-4{\textperiodcentered}6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (6{\textperiodcentered}0-8{\textperiodcentered}4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (6{\textperiodcentered}6-9{\textperiodcentered}2) for males and 6{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (5{\textperiodcentered}4-7{\textperiodcentered}7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95{\%} UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs 1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). Interpretation: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.},

abstract = {Background: Base deficit provides a more objective indicator of physiological stress following injury as compared with vital signs constituting the revised trauma score (RTS). We have previously developed a base deficit-based trauma survival prediction model [base deficit and injury severity score model (BISS)], in which RTS was replaced by base deficit as a measurement of physiological imbalance. Purpose: To externally validate BISS in a large cohort of trauma patients and to compare its performance with established trauma survival prediction models including trauma and injury severity score (TRISS) and a severity characterization of trauma (ASCOT). Moreover, we examined whether the predictive accuracy of BISS model could be improved by replacement of injury severity score (ISS) by new injury severity score (NISS) in the BISS model (BNISS). Methods: In this retrospective, observational study, clinical data of 3737 trauma patients (age ≥15 years) admitted consecutively from 2003 to 2007 were obtained from a prospective trauma registry to calculate BISS, TRISS, and ASCOT models. The models were evaluated in terms of discrimination [area under curve (AUC)] and calibration. Results: The in-hospital mortality rate was 8.1 {\%}. The discriminative performance of BISS to predict survival was similar to that of TRISS and ASCOT [AUCs of 0.883, 95 {\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.865–0.901 for BISS, 0.902, 95 {\%} CI 0.858–0.946 for TRISS and 0.864, 95 {\%} CI 0.816–0.913 for ASCOT]. Calibration tended to be optimistic in all three models. The updated BNISS had an AUC of 0.918 indicating that substitution of ISS with NISS improved model performance. Conclusions: The BISS model, a base deficit-based trauma model for survival prediction, showed equivalent performance as compared with that of TRISS and ASCOT and may offer a more simplified calculation method and a more objective assessment. Calibration of BISS model was, however, less good than that of other models. Replacing ISS by NISS can considerably improve model accuracy, but further confirmation is needed.},

abstract = {Background: As the fourth leading cause of death, injury is an important public health concern in Guangdong Province, China. The epidemiological characteristics of injury mortality is changing along with the social development. This study described the epidemiological characteristics of injury mortality in Guangdong Province by analyzing the death surveillance data in a few areas in Guangdong Province in 2015. Methods: Using the mortality data from the Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) system, injury deaths were classified according to the International Classification of Disease-10th Revision (ICD-10). The data were stratified by areas (urban/rural), gender, age groups, injury types, and then overall and type-specific injury mortality rates were estimated for the whole Guangdong Province, China. Results: We estimated that about 38,200 individuals died from injury in Guangdong Province in 2015, producing a mortality rate of 43.11/100,000. The overall age-standardized injury mortality in men was higher in rural areas compared with urban areas (41.29/100,000 versus 24.89/100,000). In terms of injury intent, unintentional injuries were the commonnest injury type, which accounted for 83.93{\%} of the overall injury deaths, however, the deaths caused by suicide should not be ignored, which occupied 12.67{\%} of the total injury deaths. In terms of injury cause type, falls, road-traffic accidents, suicide, drowning, and accidental poisoning were the top five leading types of injury deaths. Conclusions: In Guangdong Province, injury is an important cause of death. Road-traffic accidents, falls, suicide, drowning, and accidental poisoning should be the priorities of intervention. Moreover, in rural areas, the men were the most targeted subpopulation of the prevention activities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Outcome prediction models allow risk adjustment required for trauma research and the evaluation of outcomes. The advent of ICD-10-CM has rendered risk adjustment based on ICD-9-CM codes moot, but as yet no risk adjustment model based on ICD-10-CM codes has been described. METHODS The National Trauma Data Bank provided data from 773,388 injured patients who presented to one of 747 trauma centers in 2016 with traumatic injuries ICD-10-CM codes and Injury Severity Score (ISS). We constructed an outcome prediction model using only ICD-10-CM acute injury codes and compared its performance with that of the ISS. RESULTS Compared with ISS, the TMPM-ICD-10 discriminated survivors from non-survivors better (ROC TMPM-ICD-10 = 0.861 [0.860-0.872], ROC [reviever operating curve] ISS = 0.830 [0.823-0.836]), was better calibrated (HL [Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic] TMPM-ICD-10 = 49.01, HL ISS = 788.79), and had a lower Akaike information criteria (AIC TMPM-ICD10 = 30579.49; AIC ISS = 31802.18). CONCLUSIONS Because TMPM-ICD10 provides better discrimination and calibration than the ISS and can be computed without recourse to Abbreviated Injury Scale coding, the TMPM-ICD10 should replace the ISS as the standard measure of overall injury severity for data coded in the ICD-10-CM lexicon.},

abstract = {Introduction: Little evidence suggest that female gender is associated with a lower risk of mortality in severely injured patients, especially in premenopausal women. Previous clinical studies have shown contradictory results regarding protective effects of gender on outcome after severe trauma. The objective of this study was to determine the association between gender and outcome (mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission) among severely injured patients in the Netherlands. Methods: A retrospective multicentre study was performed including all polytrauma patients (Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥16) admitted to the ED of three level 1 trauma centres, between January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2014. Data on age, gender, mechanism of injury, ISS, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), prehospital intubation, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) upon admission at the Emergency Department was collected from three Regional Trauma Registries. To determine whether gender was an independent predictor of mortality and ICU admission, logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: Among 6865 trauma patients, male patients had a significantly higher ISS compared to female patients (26.3 ± 10.2 vs 25.3 ± 9.7, P = {\textless} 0.0001). Blunt trauma was significantly more common in the female group (95.2{\%} vs 92.3{\%}, P = {\textless} 0.0001). Males aged 16- to 44-years had a significant higher in-hospital mortality rate (10.4{\%} vs 13.4{\%}, P = 0.046). ICU admission rate was significantly lower in females (49.3{\%} vs 54.5{\%}, P = {\textless} 0.0001). In the overall group, logistic regression did not show gender as an independent predictor for in-hospital mortality (OR 1.020 (95{\%} CI 0.865-1.204), P = 0.811) or mortality within 24 h (OR 1.049 (95{\%} CI 0.829-1.327), P = 0.693). However, male gender was associated with an increased likelihood for ICU admission in the overall group (OR 1.205 (95{\%} CI 1.046-1.388), P = 0.010). Conclusion: The current study shows that in this population of severely injured patients, female sex is associated with a lower in-hospital mortality rate among those aged 16- to 44-years. Furthermore, female sex is independently associated with an overall decreased likelihood for ICU admission. More research is needed to examine the physiologic background of this protective effect of female sex in severe trauma.},

abstract = {Background: Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017. Methods: The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countries—Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here are age-standardised. Findings: At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 72{\textperiodcentered}5–74{\textperiodcentered}1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}9–19{\textperiodcentered}6), and injuries 8{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}7–8{\textperiodcentered}2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (21{\textperiodcentered}5–23{\textperiodcentered}9), representing an additional 7{\textperiodcentered}61 million (7{\textperiodcentered}20–8{\textperiodcentered}01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}0–8{\textperiodcentered}8). The number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 22{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (20{\textperiodcentered}0–24{\textperiodcentered}0) and the death rate by 31{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (30{\textperiodcentered}1–33{\textperiodcentered}3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}5–4{\textperiodcentered}0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (12{\textperiodcentered}2–15{\textperiodcentered}1) to 57{\textperiodcentered}9 deaths (55{\textperiodcentered}9–59{\textperiodcentered}2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000–289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000–363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (88{\textperiodcentered}8–148{\textperiodcentered}6). A greater reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such as a 36{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (32{\textperiodcentered}2–40{\textperiodcentered}6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (31{\textperiodcentered}2–36{\textperiodcentered}1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990—neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases—were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases. Interpretation: Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade.

@article{Sharpe2014,
abstract = {Background: Gender alone offers no survival advantage in humans following trauma. However, male gender does predict increased morbidity, specifically ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Previous work has shown that despite lower incidence of VAP, females with VAP have increased mortality. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the impact of VAP and gender on outcome and to determine which characteristics of severe VAP predict mortality in trauma patients. Methods: Patients with VAP (≥105 colony-forming units per milliliter in bronchoalveolar lavage) over 8 years were stratified by gender, age, severity of shock, and injury severity. Severe VAP factors were defined as multiple-episode, polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant, nosocomial VAP diagnosed within 7 days of admission (eNVAP), and multiple inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy episodes. Mortality and severe VAP factors were compared using $\chi$ analysis. Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) was performed to determine which VAP factors were independent predictors of mortality. Results: A total of 854 patients were identified, 676 men (79{\%}) and 178 women (21{\%}). Despite a higher incidence of VAP among males (3.8{\%} vs. 2.6{\%}, p = 0.001), mortality was higher in females (24{\%} vs. 15{\%}, p = .009). All characteristics of severe VAP were increased in females except multiple episodes (p = 0.15). MLR identified eNVAP as an independent predictor of mortality in females with severe VAP after adjusting for age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), admission base excess, and 24-hour transfusions (odds ratio, 9.97; p = 0.001). Conclusion: That females develop less VAP but experience increased mortality confirms previous studies. Characteristics of severe VAP are increased in females and may contribute to this observed mortality difference. MLR identified eNVAP as an independent predictor of mortality in females with severe VAP following trauma. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {The present review synthesizes evidence and discusses issues related to health care quality and equity for women, including minority population subgroups. The principle of “sameness” or women and men receiving equitable, high-quality care is a near-term target, but optimal population health cannot be achieved without consideration of the unique, gendered structural determinants of health and the development of unique care pathways optimized for women. The aim of this review is to promote enhanced awareness, develop critical thinking in sex and gender science, and identify strategic pathways to improve the cardiovascular health of women. Delineation of the components of high-quality health care, including a women-specific research agenda, remains a vital part of strategic planning to improve the lives of women at risk for or living with cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {Objective The aim was to study gender differences in care-seeking behavior and treatment provided immediately after whiplash trauma. Methods Participants were residents from a defined geographical area, Skaraborg County in the southwestern part of Sweden. A cohort of 3,368 persons exposed to whiplash trauma and attending a healthcare facility immediately after the trauma between 1999 and 2008 were identified in a database. Information about gender, age, time elapsed prior to seeking care, type of healthcare contact, initial treatment provided and eventual hospitalization time was retrieved. Results Women sought care later than men (p = 0.00074). Women consulted primary healthcare first more often than men, who more often first sought hospital care (p = 0.0060). There were no gender differences regarding the type of treatment after trauma. Women had longer hospital admission than men (p = 0.022), indicating their injuries were at least similar to or worse than men's. Conclusion Women sought healthcare later than men after whiplash trauma. Although not directly investigated in this study, it raises the question if this may reduce their probability of getting financial compensation compared to men.},

abstract = {Violence runs into the fabric of society. In recent years, violence has been identified as an important health problem in industrialised societies. In the present study, conducted to analyze injury characteristics, 813 victims of interpersonal violence presenting to emergency department at a Government Medical College and Hospital from a major city in Central India were interviewed and examined over a period of one year. Central to the quantitative analysis of the data collected was the extraction of specific injury characteristics from the sample population. The group included 606 men and 207 females, most of them were resident of urban areas, aged between 11 and 30 years. Most of attacks occurred at nights, with minimal seasonal variation. Males were more commonly attacked outdoors by a single stranger male while females were mostly attacked indoors by spouse. Blunt trauma was more commonly seen in females as compared to males. Head neck and face region was the most preferred anatomical site by the assailants. Hard and blunt weapons were used more commonly at homes (184 of 269 incidents) than at streets (301 of 561 incidents). Sharp edged and pointed weapons were most commonly used at streets. Firearms were rarely used. Occurrence of physical assaults in this region more or less follows the pattern seen in other parts of the world with local and socio-cultural differences that need to be further delved into and considered during the planning and implementation of injury prevention programs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

@article{Tohira2012,
abstract = {Many injury severity scoring tools have been developed over the past few decades. These tools include the Injury Severity Score (ISS), New ISS (NISS), Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS). Although many studies have endeavored to determine the ability of these tools to predict the mortality of injured patients, their results have been inconsistent. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the predictive performances of these tools and explore the heterogeneity among studies. We defined a relevant article as any research article that reported the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve as a measure of predictive performance. We conducted an online search using MEDLINE and Embase. We evaluated the quality of each relevant article using a quality assessment questionnaire consisting of 10 questions. The total number of positive answers was reported as the quality score of the study. Meta-analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity among studies. We identified 64 relevant articles with 157 AUROCs of the tools. The median number of positive answers to the questionnaire was 5, ranging from 2 to 8. Less than half of the relevant studies reported the version of the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and/or ICD (37.5{\%}). The heterogeneity among the studies could be observed in a broad distribution of crude mortality rates of study data, ranging from 1{\%} to 38{\%}. The NISS was mostly reported to perform better than the ISS when predicting the mortality of blunt trauma patients. The relative performance of the ICSS against the AIS-based tools was inconclusive because of the scarcity of studies. The performance of the ICISS appeared to be unstable because the performance could be altered by the type of formula and survival risk ratios used. In conclusion, high-quality studies were limited. The NISS might perform better in the mortality prediction of blunt injuries than the ISS. Additional studies are required to standardize the derivation of the ICISS and determine the relative performance of the ICISS against the AIS-based tools. {\textcopyright} 2012 Tohira et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},
